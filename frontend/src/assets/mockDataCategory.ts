    title: "Home repair & maintenance",
    mainDescription:"When you sell your property and make a profit, a 30% capital gains tax applies. You can deduct expenses for repair & maintenance for actions that have improved the condition of the property at the time of sale compared to when it was purchased.",
    example:
      "Lisa is selling her apartment. She has spent 50,000 SEK on renovations (materials and tool rentals). She enters this amount on her tax return. Lisa made a profit of 200,000 SEK when she sold the apartment, which means she needs to pay 60,000 SEK in taxes (30% of 200,000 SEK). However, because she spent 50,000 SEK on renovations, this 60,000 SEK is reduced to only 10,000 SEK.",

    title: "New additions & upgrades",
    mainDescription:"If you sell your home with profit this deduction is great if youâ€™ve made upgrades. This includes expenses for new construction, expansions, and alterations to your home. Also basic improvements that add new features or upgrade existing ones to a higher standard.",
    example:
      "John added a new room to his house for 120,000 SEK. This addition increased the living space and the overall value of the property. When John sold his house, he made a profit of 400,000 SEK. Without the deduction, his tax would have been 120,000 SEK (30% of 400,000 SEK). However, the expense of the new room reduces this tax by 120,000 SEK, meaning he doesn't owe any additional taxes from the sale.",
